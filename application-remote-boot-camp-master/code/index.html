      <h3>Backend short</h3>
      <i style="font-size:1.5vw;">"The clearest distinction between
      frontend and backend
      is that frontend is what the
      user sees and interacts with 
      in their browser,
      and backend is what never reaches
      the user's computer
      but stays on the server."</i>

      <h2>What about Backend</h2>
      <h5>Me trying to explain Backend</h5>
      <small>Current Date and Time is <span id='date-time'></span>.</small>
      <!--Script to get the days date and time -->
      <script>
        var dt = new Date();
        document.getElementById('date-time').innerHTML=dt.toDateString();
      </script>
      <p>The simplest explanation of backend is what the user does not see or interact with in their browser, it stays on the server.
        Backend is like the web page's brain, if you as a user enter an address in the browser, it is not in your own computer. It is found elsewhere on the web and is called a backend, it can consist of one or more servers that the browser contacts and asks to have a page sent to it.
        It is therefore often called backend code server-side code. Most of the logic is usually on the backend side.
        There are many languages ​​to choose from on the server side such as Java, Python and Javascript</p>
